# Sustainability Policy

At Made Tech, we are committed to sustainable development (meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs), with concern for the environment being an integral and fundamental part of this commitment. Our aim is to reduce the impact our operations have on the environment wherever possible in order to build a better world for future generations.

As an office-based business, we recognize that our impact on the environment mostly consists of energy consumption and travel.

With the aim of reducing our impact, we will:
 * communicate and promote responsibility for the environment;
 * reduce the use of energy, water and other resources wherever possible;
 * minimise waste by reduction, re-use and recycling methods;
 * avoid unnecessary travel for meetings where alternatives are available and practical;
 * comply with all relevant environmental legislation/regulation;
 * ensure that our policies and services are developed in a way that is complimentary to this policy;
 * not prioritise funding needs ahead of sustainability requirements; and
 * provide appropriate resources to meet the commitments of this policy;
