# Sustainability at Made Tech

At Made Tech we are committed to sustainable development (meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs), with concern for the environment being an integral and fundamental part of this commitment. Our aim is to reduce the impact our operations have on the environment wherever possible in order to build a better world for future generations.
