# Sustainability Policy

## About this policy

This policy applies to everyone who works for Made Tech, or who acts on Made Techâ€™s behalf. All team members have a role in promoting responsibility for the environment at work. We all have a personal responsibility to comply with the policy and to ensure, as far as possible, that others do the same.

Made Tech is responsible for this policy, and for ensuring that all our staff understand their part in adhering to it, and for any necessary training on sustainability.

This policy does not form part of your contract of employment, and we may amend it at any time.
