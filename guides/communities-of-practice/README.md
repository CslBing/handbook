# Communities of practice

We have several [communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice): groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

Check out our [podcast episode](https://www.madetech.com/resources/podcasts/episode-12-emily-webber/) where we talk about communities of practice at Made Tech.
